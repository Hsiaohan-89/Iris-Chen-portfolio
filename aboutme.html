          <h4>About Me :</h4>
          <p>
            Hello, Iâ€™m Iris, and I bring a diverse range of skills and
            experiences to the table. With a background in both the gaming
            industry and administrative support, I have honed my abilities in
            quality assurance, customer service, and efficient management of
            various tasks.
          </p>
          <h4>Professional Background :</h4>
          <p>
            In my most recent role at Activision Blizzard as a QA Localization
            Tester, I dedicated myself to ensuring the highest quality gaming
            experiences for global audiences. I meticulously tested projects,
            identifying localization and functional issues, and contributed to
            seamless integration by reviewing language components such as text
            and audio files. My ability to spot defects and provide clear and
            concise documentation in bug tracking databases was instrumental in
            maintaining product excellence. Daily regression and verification
            testing became second nature, and I even lent a hand in ad-hoc
            translations when needed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Prior to this, I served as an Administrative Assistant at Red Flag
            Wholesale Tyres. Here, I provided essential administrative support
            by collecting and analyzing data, generating reports, managing
            expenses, and processing purchase orders. My responsibilities
            extended to handling inquiries, processing orders, and maintaining
            meticulous product inventory records. Proficiency in using Sage One
            Business Cloud for invoice processing and monitoring various aspects
            of operations was a key highlight of my role.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before entering the gaming and administrative fields, I worked as a
            Customer Service Agent at SATS Ltd., where I excelled in
            coordinating with airline and ground handling crews. I was
            responsible for resolving customer inquiries and complaints,
            preparing pre-departure and post-departure reports, and using
            airline computer systems to create tickets and boarding passes. This
            experience allowed me to develop strong problem-solving and customer
            interaction skills.
